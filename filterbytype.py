# Assignment: Filter by Type
# Write a program that, given some value, tests that value for its type. 
# Here's what you should do for each type:


# Integer
# If the integer is greater than or equal to 100, print "That's a big number!" 
# If the integer is less than 100, print "That's a small number"


# String
# If the string is greater than or equal to 50 characters print "Long sentence." 
# If the string is shorter than 50 characters print "Short sentence."


# List
# If the length of the list is greater than or equal to 10 print "Big list!" 
# If the list has fewer than 10 values print "Short list."
